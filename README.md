# Welcome to the Hive-Five wiki!

# We will describe the implementation of our project on this GitHub.

Nowadays, the survival of 80% of flowering plants and the production of 35% of human food directly depend on pollinators.
In the 1990s, 10% of bee colonies were disappearing each year. Today, between 20 to 80% of bee colonies are disappearing each year.

There are increasing threats to bees:

- Varroa mite, an Parasitic mite, introduced in France since 1982.

- New insecticides, such as neonicotinoids, which affect the nervous system of insects and were introduced in the 1990s.

- Asian hornets introduced in France since 2006.

- Climate change, including extreme heat and drought.

- Increasing hive thefts in recent years for the honey business.

Following these observations, we have decided to undertake a project : 

**Create a connected box that monitors the real-time status of a beehive. We check parameters such as temperature, humidity, and other metrics to determine if the hive is more or less productive.**

The project aims to develop a comprehensive embedded system, integrating sensors, a microcontroller, a communication module, and the necessary electronics for power management. The main objective is to provide real-time monitoring of the hive to optimize bee health and honey production. 

Our first sessions involved understanding the project context by defining the project boundaries : 

For the Implementation: 

On the Hardware : we prototyped on a Labdec board followed by designing a printed circuit board (PCB). 
For the software : we needed to program the microcontroller and connect it to the Things Network

Software Resources Used:

◼ Electronic Design: KiCAD for designing printed circuit boards (PCB).

◼ Development Environment: Using the Arduino IDE for microcontroller programming.

Hardware Resources Used:

◼ Laboratory Equipment:  oscilloscope, power supply, function generator, and soldering station.

◼ Fabrication Tools: Using an engraver and equipped workshop with cable sheath, a heat gun, a filing machine.

◼ Basic Components: Utilization of electronic components such as resistors, essential for building the embedded system.

We had to create an account on The Things Network.

The Things Network (TTN) is a global decentralized network dedicated to the Internet of Things (IoT), utilizing LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) technology. This network was created with the aim of providing an **open and free infrastructure for connecting IoT devices over long distances with minimal energy consumption** . All of these characteristics are ideal and align with our project.
